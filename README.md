# SkillMaxxing

SkillMaxxing is a minimalist micro-learning web app that helps users learn any skill in 30 days. Users simply enter the skill they want to learn, and an AI agent generates a structured 30-day plan with small, achievable daily tasks. The experience is designed to be calm and realistic, automatically adapting when users miss days or feel overwhelmed, so learning always feels manageable rather than stressful.
